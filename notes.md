# Jiffy

- With create react app , we can write methods inside component as arrow functions instead of using constructor and bind
- `onChange()` Fires when there’s a change in any of the form’s input elements, each keystroke
- Can not use `console.log(event.key);` to see key presses
- To see what key we use we need to use `onKeyPress()`
